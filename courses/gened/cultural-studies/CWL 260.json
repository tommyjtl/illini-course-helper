Following the paths of these two questions, we will journey through some of the most vibrant and provocative African American texts written between the Great War and the 1980s.  From the cautious optimism of the Harlem Renaissance to the cautious skepticism of postmodernity, this course engages the trials and triumphs of black literature in the modern U.S.  In addition to close readings of literary art, we will also take advantage of visual media (documentaries and movies) and visual art (paintings and performance art) to give a full picture of the complexities that went into black writing in this period.",
