Over the course of the semester, we will follow technological developments in Europe and the United States from the Industrial Revolution to the twenty-first century. Course readings will explore some of the fundamental debates in the history of technology: Does humanity shape and control technology, or does technology shape and control us? Is modern technology an engine of social progress or a runaway train speeding toward disaster? Technologies examined will include plastics, steamboats, cars, atomic energy, chemical weapons, and carbon capture machines.",
