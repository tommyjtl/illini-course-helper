            "info": "SP 24 - ENGL 285 - Postcolonial Literature in English - Rebecca Oh - Overseas colonialism was a project of European domination over the rest of the world. But it also demands to be understood as a relationship, however unequal, between European colonizers and non-European colonized peoples. In this course we will investigate how power and resistance are configured within colonial relations and their aftermaths. How does power get produced and contested? By whom is it held? What are its effects? We will focus these questions through the potentials and pitfalls of language and literature. How does English, the language of former colonizers, come to represent diverse forms of non-European experience? How is it taken up, changed, and appropriated to “write back” to empire? Relatedly we will ask how postcolonial writers deploy unique narrative forms, genres, and styles to represent colonized experience. Our inquiries into language and power will lead us to consider ongoing political, cultural, and economic inequalities as well as how nation, race, gender, and class affect postcolonial experience. Most of our texts will be drawn from the twentieth century, and may include films, drama, novels, poetry, and theory/criticism.",
