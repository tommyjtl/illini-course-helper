You will design and conduct original ethnographic research projects on the use of social media and consumerism and the impact of migration on campus. Since multi media and the Internet are such important vehicles for global movement, your final project will involve creating a multi-media presentation that that analyzes the ways the U of I community (and you as a U of I student) are globally connected through the circulation of people, ideas and commodities.",
