When you imagine a Buddhist, whom do you see and what they doing?   The act of seeing has a prominent place in the Buddhist tradition, a fact that is observable in the abundance of images of Buddhas and other Buddhist figures found across the Buddhist world and evident in the rich visual imagery employed in Buddhist texts to communicate the truth that the Buddha discovered. This course is designed to introduce students to Buddhism through the close reading of primary texts, images and movies, whereby we will examine its central doctrines and practices and open our eyes to the diverse cultural expressions of the Buddhist tradition in India, Southeast Asia, Tibet, China, Japan and the West.",
