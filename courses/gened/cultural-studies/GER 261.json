            "info": "This course is designed as an introduction to the study of literary, cinematographic, and theoretical representations of the Holocaust. Through close readings of texts and films, students will grapple with some of the fundamental concerns, challenges, and philosophical debates provoked by the Nazi genocide. By situating the Holocaust in the context of its literary, cinematographic, and theoretical afterlife, the course foregrounds the problem of representation. We will look closely at the way works of literature have testified to the impossibility of the task of representing the Holocaust and the necessity of nevertheless attempting it.  World War II marked a dramatic shift in how we commemorate war. Focus moved from honouring the heroes on the battlefield to honouring the victims, a transition described as the “ethical turn in memory culture” or Erinnerungspolitik(memory politics).  Trauma – and responding to catastrophic events – has become central to present-day politics, central to the constitution of the modern subject. This shift will take centerstage in our discussions of the difficulties encountered by museums and memorials in their attempts to commemorate victims. Central to these discussions will be the questions: Under what conditions do we fail to mourn others? and How should we mourn? The question of how will lead us into discussions of aesthetics. In many ways the works we will look at this semester will prove to be experiments in mourning an event that must not be forgotten. The course is organised into 6 units: Under What Conditions Do We Fail to Mourn Others, The Necessity and Impossibility of Testimony, Fascist Aesthetics, Holocaust Documentaries, Evil’s Banality, and Second-Hand Memory. Students will develop the following skills: close reading, film analysis, critical thinking, thesis formulation.",
