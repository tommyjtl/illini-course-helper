This course offers a survey of classical tradition through the work of Alexandrian Greek poet Constantine Cavafy (1863-1933). In his work, the poet reworks themes from writers of the Classical Greek, Roman, and Late Antique periods to create poem-landmarks of modernity that readers around the world continue to read today in various languages and translations. Some of the themes his poetry engages with, and we explore in the course, are Hellenism, exile, displacement, empire, colonialism, politics, homosexuality, decadence, time, art, old age, and lives of subjects confronted with existential pain. The course is suitable for students interested in Modern Greek Studies, Mediterranean Studies, English, Comparative Literature, History, Religion, and Modernity.",
