Students will participate in the entire grant writing cycle -- from researching funding opportunities to final submission -- and will work with local nonprofits to complete a polished grant on their behalf. The class will investigate the grant-writing process and its many genres and forms, including needs assessments, program assessments, letters of inquiry, RFPs (Requests for Proposals), and the most common sections of grant applications. Working with a team of peers and a community client, students will develop project management and collaborative writing skills. Students will explore the landscape of local grant-writing by meeting other grant-writing professionals and community organizations and use statewide and national databases and tools to identify current grant-writing trends and best practices. Students pursuing careers in social work, social services, or the nonprofit sector, or those who plan to work with state governments, local governments, or NGOs will benefit the most from this class, although the class is open to all majors and interests.",
