            "info": "Title: Empire  Topic: This course examines the role and significance of empires in history, from the earliest empires in the Fertile Crescent to the collapse of the British Empire in the mid-20th Century. For more than a millennia, empire has been the dominant form of political structuring and students will explore how the system remained in place by examining specific case studies and developing their own research projects. While the case studies will center on European empires, students are invited to focus their own research on any topic related to empire, regardless of geographic or temporal boundaries. As the capstone course for history majors, students will be expected to work both on class material as well as their own research project, utilizing both primary and secondary sources.",

This seminar is an introduction to medievalism: the conceptions, constructs, and fantasies of the medieval past that are constantly shaped and reshaped by fresh historical circumstances and perspectives. It explores how various, and often contradictory, meanings attached to “the medieval” have helped to make sense of modern problems and developments, and it offers participants the opportunity to pursue original research on one of its many facets.",

            "info": "Topic: After Empire:  Europe in the Wake of Total War and Decolonization Description:  The twentieth century saw the collapse of most European empires, a process that accelerated in the wake of two world wars. We typically imagine decolonization as a process that unfolded primarily in the so-called peripheries of empires, as former colonies found new footing as independent states. However, decolonization also profoundly shaped European countries as they emerged in the wake of world wars and imperial collapse. Shed of colonies, European countries navigated a new and uncertain world, as states and citizens alike grappled with imperial legacies. In this course, we explore post-imperial European history, considering discourses of nation- and statehood, post-imperial migration, international relations, imperial nostalgia, and contested memory politics. Europe’s “post-imperial” history will be used a springboard for developing original research projects.",
